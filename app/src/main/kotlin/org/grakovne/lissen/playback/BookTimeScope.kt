/**
 * Single shared snapshot of the book-time scope decision, taken once when a playlist is built.
 *
 * The snapshot is written from [PlaybackService.preparePlayback] and
 * [MediaLibrarySessionCallback.onSetMediaItems], which build playlists, and from
 * [MediaLibrarySessionCallback.onPlaybackResumption]. The resumption callback also fires for
 * metadata-only requests (isForPlayback = false, e.g. System UI populating its playback
 * resumption notification after reboot): media3 does not build a playlist there, it only consumes
 * the returned item's metadata. The write is then harmless — the next real playlist build rewrites
 * it, and in the meantime both sides fail closed because the timeline's mediaIds do not change.
 * If a playlist is ever built anywhere else, the snapshot must be updated there too; the mediaId
 * cross-check in [resolveBookTimeTranslation] then falls back to chapter scope rather than
 * translating against a stale book.
 *
 * Everyone that translates player times goes through the one predicate in
 * [resolveBookTimeTranslation]: the media session player (position, duration and seek mappings)
 * and the progress updater in [MediaRepository], which resolves the controller's view of the same
 * timeline. Because the value is fixed at playlist build time and the predicate is shared, none of
 * them can ever disagree about the scope, and the book-time setting applies when the next
 * playlist is prepared rather than instantly.
